# find-the-hat-game
This is from the Codecademy course to create a terminal based game where you need to find a hat and avoid pitfalls in the process.
Although far from perfect, I worked through the requirements as much as I could, finally pausing on step 6. I managed to create a version of the helper method to create a field play area, but I stopped short of implementing it into the main game as I didn't want to dwell on this project too much. In the future I may get round to completing this.
